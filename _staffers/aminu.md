I am Aminu, a Senior and CS major from Nigeria. Technology should be inclusive and welcoming for all; thus, I hope to build, leverage, integrate, and continually improve the tech to solve problems and create experiences that everyone can cohabitate safely. I am a TA to not only introduce students to CS but importantly offer proper career placement and counseling to gain clarity on merging their interests plus developing skills and exposure.
