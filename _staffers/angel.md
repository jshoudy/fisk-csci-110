Hi, my name is Angel and I am a sophomore majoring in Biology and Data Science. I am excited to be your TA in this course because it was my favorite course from last fall, and I hope to help you all have a great experience in it as well. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, concerns, or just for a casual chat!
