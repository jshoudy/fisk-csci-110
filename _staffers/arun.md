I am Arun, a  junior majoring in Computer Science. I like to involve myself in sports such as Cricket, Soccer, and Table Tennis. One Fun Fact about me is I started my major as Chemistry and later changed to Computer Science.

I took my first ever GIR class in 2020 and it was one of the best experiences I ever had. Before this class, I had a very minimal experience with Programming and I was not very much confident that I would be able to do good in Computer Science but, my professor and my TA really helped me and this class really solidify my foundation in CS-related concepts. So, I would like to share my experiences, and learnings as a TA and at the same time, I look forward to learning from all of you.

I am very much open to conversations so you can reach me at any time and let us be connected on Linkedin.
