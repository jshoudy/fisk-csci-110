I graduated from University of Washington in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. I've been a software engineer at Google Seattle ever since working on Cloud UI widgets, Google Maps user generated content, and now Google Maps basemap data quality (everything related to roads & buildings). This semester, I'm taking time off of my day job to teach this class full-time as a part of Google's GIR program. We have partnered with Fisk for many years now (7?) and I am so excited to be here!
