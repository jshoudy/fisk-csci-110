## Overview
CSCI 110 is an introductory class designed for students with no formal exposure to computer science or programming. The goal is to provide a gentle but thorough introduction to computer science that will prepare students to either take further computer science courses, or use computer science in their field of study.

By the end of the course, students will learn
 - Variables, Expressions, Types
 - Input/Output
 - Logic and Control Flow
 - Functions
 - Testing and Debugging
 - Basic Algorithms
 - Runtime and efficiency
 - Objects and Classes
 - Sets and Dictionaries

## Course Meetings
Lectures, labs, and office hours are the main ways in which you will interact with your professor and TAs. You can see the weekly schedule of course meetings on the [course schedule page](schedule.md). Lectures, labs, and professor's office hours will be held in Park-Johnson 322.

### Lecture
Lecture will be held in Park-Johnson 322 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Lecture will be focused on introducing new concepts with some time to practice built in. Attendance will be recorded. There are three sections and each student should attend one of them:
 - MWF 8-9:20am
 - MWF 11am-12:20pm
 - MWF 3:30-4:50pm

### Labs
Labs will be held in Park-Johnson 322 on Tuesdays. Labs will provide an environment for students to work on homeworks and projects with readily available help. There are three sections for labs and each student should attend one of them:
 - T 8-9:50am
 - T 12:30-2:20pm
 - T 3-4:50pm

You should take advantage of labs as you can ask the professor or TAs for help on completing the assignments. 

### Office Hours

We will hold in-person office hours at a wide variety of times. In-person office hours with Prof. Shoudy will be held in Park-Johnson 322 on MWF from 2:30-3:30 and on Thursdays from 10am-12pm. Additionally please stop by Prof. Shoudy's office (Park-Johnson 229) at any time outside of these hours and if he is there he will be happy to help you. You are welcome to come to office hours for any reason, including course material questions, lecture clarifications, industry interview prep, career path discussions, or just to hang out.

Additionally TAs will hold there own office hours. TAs are upperclassmen that have taken this class in the past. The schedule for all office hours can be found at the [course schedule page](schedule.md).

As a course, we commit to making sure no student fails the class due to lack of class resources, so if you are behind or confused, please reach out for help. The course staff will make themselves as available as possible to help you.

## Policies

### Grade

Your final grade will be calculated based on your exams, homeworks, projects, and quizzes. See the section below for a detailed breakdown. Depending on the difficulty of the material, a curve may be applied to increase grades at the end of the semester. A curve will never be used to decrease grades. Final grades will be assigned according to:

| Grade | Range |
|:------|:------|
| A | 90% <= score |
| A- | 85% <= score < 90% |
| B+ | 80% <= score < 85% |
| B | 75% <= score < 80% |
| B- | 70% <= score < 75% |
| C+ | 65% <= score < 70% |
| C | 60% <= score < 65% |
| C- | 55% <= score < 60% |
| D | 50% <= score < 55% |
| E | score < 50% |
 
### Grade Weighting

There will be two grading systems, both very similar, which will be applied to your work throughout the course. **Your final grade will be the greater of the two scores.** The intention here is to provide a slight benefit to those students who performed really well on projects but may have had slightly lower exam scores or vice versa. The two weighting systems are:

| Assignment Type | Weight in Overall Grade System 1 | Weight in Overall Grade System 2 |
|:-------------|:------|:------|
| Midterm Exam 1 |  7%  | 13% |
| Midterm Exam 2 | 12%  | 18% |
| Final Exam | 17% | 23% |
| Homeworks | 13% | 7% |
| Project 1 | 18% | 12% |
| Project 2 | 23% | 17% |
| Quizzes | 5% | 5% |
| Participation | 5% | 5% |

### Assignments
These details are subject to change during the semester, however the current plan of record is the following:

- Weekly Quizzes - short quiz every Friday that is not an exam week (also excluding the first week). 
- Homeworks - spread throughout the semester. Work individually, submit individually.
- 2 Projects - Blackjack and TBD

Assignments will be due at 11:59pm, with a 10% penalty per each day that the assignment is late up to 5 days total. Everyone gets 2 free late days that do not count against them. Late days can be used on homeworks but not on projects.

### Exams
Instead of one midterm and one final exam, this course will have 3 exams, spaced roughly evenly across the semester, with the third exam happening during finals week. Exam 1 will be on Wednesday, September 14th. Exam 2 is will be on Friday, October 28th. Exam 3 will take place during finals week. Each exam will be worth an increased percentage of the final grade to reward students that make progress throughout the semester. 

For each of the midterm exams, if a student brings a missed question to instructor office hours and thoroughly explains the correct answer, they may earn 50% of the missed points back for that question.
### Cheating

For all assignments in the course, you may discuss approaches to solving a problem or work in the same room on separate computers to individually solve a problem, but **you may *not* copy and paste code or substantially copy ideas from another student**. Additionally the internet is a great source for getting help when your stuck but **you may *not* copy and paste code directly from the internet.** It can be tempting to cheat. Know that all code submitted to Replit will be run through a very good plagiarism detector.

For assignments (homeworks and projects):
Cheating is not tolerated. 1st time: automatic 0 for copier and copied (if applicable). 2nd time: automatic failure in the course. If you are struggling because there's not enough time or the concepts are difficult, email the professor. Extensions are available if you let me know what's going on.

For exams and quizzes:
Cheating is not tolerated. Any student caught cheating will fail the course, regardless of their numerical average in the class at the time. Cheating activities include but are not limited to conferring with one another during a test by text messaging, talking, hand signals, roaming eyes, and other signals. Do not allow others to look at answers on your paper.

If I ask you how your code works and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don't take the risk. Despite this explicit warning, each year, a few students still cheat and are caught. I do not enjoy catching and penalizing students for plagiarism, but it's necessary for maintaining a fair classroom. The course staff will work tirelessly to provide enough support for any student to get help and make it through the class. In exchange, we ask you to uphold academic integrity and not to plagiarize code or ideas.

## Resources

This course website, [csci110.org](https://www.csci110.org), will be your one-stop resource for the syllabus, schedule, slides, and assignment links. Additionally, we will be using the following software.

**Replit**
You will get a link to sign up for this tool when we begin class. We will use Replit for editing code and turning in assignments. Note that Replit may display a “grade” for you, but the official one is in Canvas.

**Piazza**
This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. You can find the [class Piazza here](https://piazza.com/fisk/fall2022/csci110/home).

**Canvas**
Your official class midterm and final grades will be published in Canvas. You should already have a Canvas account. Get in touch with your advisor if you can't access the course on Canvas. Other than occasionally syncing grades to Canvas, we will not be using it.
